minesweeper
===========
This is my (unfinished) implementation of Minesweeper in JavaScript! Minesweeper is one of my favorite games ever and I decided to take a crack at implementing it myself to improve my understanding of the game. Eventually, I would like to use my implementation to write a Minesweeper solver and teaching tool.
